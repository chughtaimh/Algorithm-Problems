"# Traveling-Salesman-Problem" 

From Wikipedia:
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.

My goal is to implement multiple approaches to solving this problem. This is more an intellectual excersize than an attempt at finding the most optimal solution. As such, for the most part these documents will include limited testing and benchmarking.
